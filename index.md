Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop uses a tabular ecology dataset and teaches data cleaning, management, analysis and visualization.

## Getting Started

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow. To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download
the data and install everything before working through this lesson.

This workshop assumes no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop.

To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](#setup-instructions-for-your-workshop) tab to
get access to the required software and data for this workshop.

## Data

The data for this workshop are is the [Portal Project Teaching Database](https://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459) available on FigShare, with a CC-BY license available for reuse.

The Portal Project Teaching Database is a simplified version of the Portal
Project Database designed for teaching. It is a tabular dataset of observations
of small mammals in a desert ecosystem in Arizona, USA, collected over more than 40 years.
It provides a real world example of
life-history, population, and ecological data, with sufficient complexity to
teach many aspects of data analysis and management, but with many complexities
removed to allow students to focus on the core ideas and skills being taught.

# Workshop Overview

The workshop can be taught using R or Python as the base language. All workshops start with a lesson on organizing data effectively in
spreadsheets, followed by a lesson on data cleaning with OpenRefine. Each workshop will then include **either** a lesson on R **or** a
lesson on Python. Both the R and Python lessons focus on data import, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. Workshops may also
include a lesson on working with data in a relational database using SQL, at the discretion of the instructors.
