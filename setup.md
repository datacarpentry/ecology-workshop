### Spreadsheet program

To interact with spreadsheets, we can use LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, or other programs. 
Commands may differ a bit between programs, but the general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same. For this workshop, 
we recommend using either Microsoft Excel (paid software) or LibreOffice (free and open source). Other spreadsheet programs may
not have all of the features we will be exploring in this workshop.

To install LibreOffice, go to their [download page](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/). The website should
automatically select the correct option for your operating system. Click the "Download" button. You will go to a page that asks about a
donation, but you don’t need to make one. Your download should begin automatically. Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it (you may need to open your Downloads folder) and LibreOffice should install.

### OpenRefine

OpenRefine is a Java program that runs on your local machine (not on the cloud). Although it displays in your browser, no web connection
is needed and your data remains local.

This lesson has been tested with all versions of OpenRefine up to the latest tested version, 3.2. If you are using an older version, it is recommended you upgrade to the latest tested version.

To install OpenOffice, go to their [download page](http://openrefine.org/download.html). From the download page, select either "Windows 
kit", "Mac kit", or "Linux kit" - depending on your operating system - and follow the instructions next to your download link. 

You may get an error message: "OpenRefine.app can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer." If you get this message, 
open your system preferences and click "Security & Privacy". You will see a message "OpenRefine.app was blocked from opening because it
is from an unidentified developer." Click "Open Anyway" and "Yes". OpenRefine should open in your default web browser. 

OpenRefine is a Java application, and you need to have a ‘Java Runtime Environment’ (JRE) installed on your computer to run OpenRefine. If you don’t already have one installed then you can download and install from http://java.com by going to the site and clicking “Free Java Download”.

OpenRefine does not support Internet Explorer or Edge. Please use Firefox, Chrome or Safari instead.
