### OpenRefine

- OpenRefine is a Java program that runs on your local machine (not on the cloud). Although it displays in your browser, no web
  connection is needed and your data remains local. You need to have a â€˜Java Runtime Environment' (JRE) installed on your computer to run
  OpenRefine. If you don't already have one installed and are running Windows, then you can download the "Windows kit with embedded Java" version from the downloads page. You can also download and install Java from [https://java.com](https://java.com) by going to the site and clicking "Free Java Download".

- To install OpenRefine, go to their [download page](https://openrefine.org/download.html). From the download page, select either "Windows
  kit", "Mac kit", or "Linux kit" - depending on your operating system - and follow the instructions next to your download link. This
  lesson has been tested with the recent versions of OpenRefine, at least 3.4.1. **If you are using an older version, it is
  recommended you upgrade to the latest tested version.**

- You may get an error message: "OpenRefine.app can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer." If you get this message,
  open your system preferences and click "Security \& Privacy". You will see a message "OpenRefine.app was blocked from opening because it
  is from an unidentified developer." Click "Open Anyway" and "Yes". OpenRefine should open in your default web browser.

- OpenRefine does not support Internet Explorer or Edge. Please use Firefox, Chrome or Safari instead.
