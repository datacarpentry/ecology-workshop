### OpenRefine

* OpenRefine is a Java program that runs on your local machine (not on the cloud). Although it displays in your browser, no web 
connection is needed and your data remains local. You need to have a ‘Java Runtime Environment’ (JRE) installed on your computer to run 
OpenRefine. If you don’t already have one installed then you can download and install from http://java.com by going to the site and 
clicking “Free Java Download”.

* To install OpenRefine, go to their [download page](http://openrefine.org/download.html). From the download page, select either "Windows 
kit", "Mac kit", or "Linux kit" - depending on your operating system - and follow the instructions next to your download link. This 
lesson has been tested with all versions of OpenRefine up to the latest tested version, 3.2. **If you are using an older version, it is 
recommended you upgrade to the latest tested version.** After installing, you can delete the installer `.dmg` file. 

* You may get an error message: "OpenRefine.app can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer." If you get this message, 
open your system preferences and click "Security & Privacy". You will see a message "OpenRefine.app was blocked from opening because it
is from an unidentified developer." Click "Open Anyway" and "Yes". OpenRefine should open in your default web browser. 

* OpenRefine does not support Internet Explorer or Edge. Please use Firefox, Chrome or Safari instead.
