### Python and Jupyter Notebooks

[Python](https://python.org) is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. 
For this workshop we use Python version 3.x.
Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be a bit difficult, so we provide an environment file to help you take care of them all together.
We will use the _Miniforge_ distribution of Python.

Please refer to the [Python section of the workshop website for installation instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#python).
